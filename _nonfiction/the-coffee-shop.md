writeup: There was something about that old coffee shop that carried so many stories
  with her. I remember I was sitting on that small table waiting for his call. I was
  very frustrated and impatient because the time difference was now killing me. Meanwhile,
  the frustration was forming a cyclone inside my brain, I saw someone right next
  to my table with a bunch of yellow roses and a big smile on his face. everybody
  around was looking at him and laughing as if he was a joker. He used to sit there
  for hours with a big smile waiting patiently for the love of his life. Smoked two
  and a half cigarettes and two cups of espresso. I saw him every day coming to that
  coffee shop, waiting with fresh flowers, smoked and after 2 hours go back disappointed.
  I walked towards his table to sit and understand him and all he did was gave me
  a letter which says "Meet me at our favorite place at 5 where you proposed to me
  and promised to stay with me forever". The letter was one month old and he was waiting
  for her to come for one month. This is pathetic. I told myself. How could she just
  leave him waiting like this and now she is lost may be found someone new? He left
  but before that, he told me one thing which left me with a question mark on my thoughts.
  After someday of overthinking and frustrated mind I go back to that old cafe, order
  the same old coffee, wait for his call, again when I realize something strange.
  That old man was nowhere to be seen. Maybe he realized that she betrayed him but
  when I asked that old lady, she said he died a few days back. And his love of life
  died exactly one month back in an accident when she was coming here to meet him.
  Things got clear in my mind. " Don't let him go" was the last thing he told him.
  And that was the last time I visited that old coffee shop because things changed
  after that. I left him, he found someone better and I am still stuck with my frustration
  and still waiting for his call to come, one day. <br />
