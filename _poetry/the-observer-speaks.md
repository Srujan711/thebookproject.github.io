Out on my nightly routine,  
I let out another long sigh.  
As my light pierces clean,  
Through a blackish blue veil,  
It holds the eye of my companion.  
I push the weightless red  
Further down into the shrouds  
Of smoke and mist that hang  
Above these ephemeral proud beings.  
I chuckle at their momentary glory  
And listen to the sorrow  
Of these circling, feathered creatures.  
The light so bright they say,  
Would blinden their sight one day.  
The smoke so obscure they say,  
Would pin them to their greeds every day.  
Their deeds so bizarre they say,  
Would lead them nowhere in any way.
