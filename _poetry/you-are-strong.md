writeup: |-
  The cool breeze of December<br />
  And you are alone, walking<br />
  Dancing to the bird chirps<br />
  Retrospecting your past<br />
  Understanding how life works<br />
  <br />
  You realize<br />
  Perhaps, every heartbreak you had<br />
  Made you sad<br />
  But, you must know<br />
  It<br />
  Made you stronger<br />
  <br />
  Perhaps, every enemy<br />
  Was the dichotomy<br />
  Of the pain, and of the learning<br />
  That<br />
  Made you stronger<br />
  <br />
  There you are<br />
  Standing strong<br />
  No matter<br />
  If everything in life, goes wrong<br />
  You are strong<br />
  <br />
  Sing with me<br />
  While dancing to the<br />
  Winter bird song<br />
  "Nothing can break me <br />
  'Cause I am strong"<br />
